I was attempting to edit an image from my media library, and found that I was unable to crop or resize it.Â  There wasn't even a sign of the image. The only error that the error console gave was "**Image corrupt or truncated**"

I found that if you are to remove all **white space**, after the **closing php** tag from the **functions.php**, it fixes the problem .
