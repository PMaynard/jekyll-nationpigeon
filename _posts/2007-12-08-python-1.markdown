Okay to start download <a href="http://python.org/download/">python</a> (If your running Linux, you will allready have it installed.&nbsp; And don't<strong> </strong>goto python.com)  Once you have python installed look for the python interpreator or shell.   Once you have located that you simply type:
<pre>print "Hello World!"</pre>
That will print "Hello World!" to the screen. If you want that to be in afile so that you can save it open up your best text editor and write
<pre>print "Hello World!"</pre>
Then save as "<filename>.py".  This is a quick way but not completly correct way of writing hello world in python.

Hope this helps, any questions just ask.
