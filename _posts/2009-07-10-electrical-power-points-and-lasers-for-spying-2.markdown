From the Black Hat USA 2009 in LA that will happen this month, Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco, show how to capture data from a power outlet and useing a cheqap laser.

See [here ](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/070909-electrical-data-theft.html?hpg1=bn&source=NWWNLE_nlt_security_2009-07-10)for more details, I think it's pritty cool.Â  There has been talk about data loggin useing the power of the unsheilded keys from a keyboard, the laser is a very cool way to datalog.
