See <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/070909-electrical-data-theft.html?hpg1=bn&amp;source=NWWNLE_nlt_security_2009-07-10" target="_blank">here </a>for more details, I think it's pritty cool.&nbsp; There has been talk about data loggin useing the power of the unsheilded keys from a keyboard, the laser is a very cool way to datalog.
