<p>The <strong>OCZ Neural Impulse Actuator Controller</strong> the first neural interface made for games, and for only <strong>&pound;97</strong>.&nbsp; This is great you will be able to walk, shot and play games just by thinking about it.&nbsp; Although I think from what I have read around the place it takes a little getting used to, but once that is done its great.&nbsp; Think of all the things that you can do with it.&nbsp; I wonder what it will be like in 3 years I hope they catch on!</p>
