The **OCZ Neural Impulse Actuator Controller** the first neural interface made for games, and for only **£97**.  This is great you will be able to walk, shot and play games just by thinking about it.  Although I think from what I have read around the place it takes a little getting used to, but once that is done its great.  Think of all the things that you can do with it.  I wonder what it will be like in 3 years I hope they catch on!
