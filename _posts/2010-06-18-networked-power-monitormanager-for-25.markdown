This idea came from the random future films and adverts.  Yeah it has been done before, but I was wondering how easy it would be to make something like this with out spending loads of money.  I mean I've seen web servers made the size of business cards and cost about the same, so if you were to mix that with some fancy wiring, power monitor and a power off timer.  Wouldn't you make a network power monitor and manager?  You could then write some cool little application that will give you statistics and other random information.

Okay so lets make a list of the items that you might need:
<ul> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ecosaver-Power-Energy-Monitor-Meter/dp/B00147F48Q/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1276881354&amp;sr=8-5">Power monitor</a> AKA Ecosaver Plug In Power Energy Monitor Meter <strong>&pound;10.99</strong>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-Accessories-SEC0955907-Compact-Digital/dp/B000Q7PVO2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1276881463&amp;sr=1-1">Power manager</a> AKA Compact Digital Timer <strong>&pound;8.95</strong>
Fancy wiring <strong>&pound;5(ish)</strong></ul>
yeah .. so if you where to take them all apart and wire them up to some sort of control board there you have it a networked power monitor/manager for only &pound;25.  hehe yeah well that's a random idea I had, it would&nbsp;probably&nbsp;explode and the "some sort of control board" would&nbsp;probably&nbsp;take up more time and work than I am thinking of. &nbsp; But hey its an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof
