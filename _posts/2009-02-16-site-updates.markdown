Now updated site, I have updated wordpress nice and shiny new.  I have also changed the theme which I like but not really like and I had to edit the header to fit in my nationpigeon banner (Which still has the white lines >_<) which loads slow and annoying, but this will have to do for now, so untill I get around to making my own design this one will have to be it.

The old design has been there since the start of the site, which is about a year and five months now ^_^
