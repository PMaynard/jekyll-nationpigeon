Finally after all this time sky\[UK\] will be airing the last three episode's of Avatar: The Last Air bender.  We in the UK can finally watch the new and last Avatar!  We have waited a year since they aired book3, [see post](http://www.nationpigeon.com/archives/4), which was great and now finally they have got around to airing the last episode's!  Make sure that you set a reminder or even better recoded it!  I have been able to not see many spoilers but I still know some :(

I'm not to sure on the exact date but it's coming I saw an advert!
