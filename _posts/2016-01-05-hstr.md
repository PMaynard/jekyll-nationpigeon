Found out about this nice little tool which upgrades bash and zsh's history searching.

You can optionally configure it by: 

	hh --show-configuration >> ~/.bashrc

It appears to add the above defaults to your bashrc without your consent. I installed it by adding the developers repository to apt-get as [advised](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md#debianmint). It also apears to only have monochromatic or hicolor settings, I'd like it more if I could configure each colour option.
