Right sorry I havent updated for a while (well okay i'm not) but I have had a really cool idea it is to create a MMORPG!  So I have been useing up all my resources to find out infos on game creation (again) http://gpwiki.org/ they where good help.

First it was going to by C++ then Python then C++ agian then Java then back to C++ then Python and then C++ and now finally Java.  I beilive it will be writen in java and [lwjgl](http://www.lwjgl.org/) and for the 3D bits i think I will be using [java3D ](https://java3d.dev.java.net/)or [jpct](http://www.jpct.net/).  So that is the reason why I havent been writting much.

Now if anyone wants to help just say!  I know Steve is :D

Pete away!
