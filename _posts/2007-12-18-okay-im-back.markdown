Right sorry I havent updated for a while (well okay i'm not) but I have had a really cool idea it is to create a MMORPG!  So I have been useing up all my resources to find out infos on game creation (again) http://gpwiki.org/ they where good help.

First it was going to by C++ then Python then C++ agian then Java then back to C++ then Python and then C++ and now finally Java.  I beilive it will be writen in java and <a href="http://www.lwjgl.org/">lwjgl</a> and for the 3D bits i think I will be using <a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/">java3D </a>or <a href="http://www.jpct.net/">jpct</a>.  So that is the reason why I havent been writting much.

Now if anyone wants to help just say!  I know Steve is :D

Pete away!
