If you are having probalems with your fresh install of Fedora 13 and it says soemthing about first boot.  Then give this ago it disables the first boot script "<strong>chkconfig --levels 35 firstboot off</strong>", although I did have to manualy create my user account "<strong>useradd username</strong>" and then set the password "<strong>passwd username</strong>"

See ya space Cowboy!
