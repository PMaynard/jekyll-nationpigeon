If you are having probalems with your fresh install of Fedora 13 and it says soemthing about first boot.  Then give this ago it disables the first boot script "**chkconfig --levels 35 firstboot off**", although I did have to manualy create my user account "**useradd username**" and then set the password "**passwd username**"

See ya space Cowboy!
