Okay I have decided that we will use the <a href="http://jmonkeyengine.com/" target="_blank">jmonkeyengine</a> as Codename StarQuests graphics engine :D

I have managed to create a simple TCP client in Java using the java.net files, and then I have managed to make it implode so once I have that working I will make it so that the client can send data to the server and the server will connect to a MySQL database and sent the data from the database back to the client :D and then hopefully add a GUI to both the client and server.

Now I must finish my Java Assignment for collage.

Pete away!
