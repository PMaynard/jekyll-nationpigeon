Its never there when you want it, but always when you don't.  

Right click open location in terminal, this is a very useful feature and saves loads of time.  
To install it in Ubuntu and any other distribution that uses nautilus, install the package _nautilus-open-terminal_
    
    sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal
    su -c 'yum install nautilus-open-terminal'
