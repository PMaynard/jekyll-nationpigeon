I have decide to start work on a simple RTS game, it will use python and some other modules.  I will start work on it once I have finished collage, next week, I hope to have it completed or at least more than half way finished by the start of the collage.  The game will be open source and I will keep a log of how I created and what tutorial/information I have used to learn the python language.

There are three main goals, these are:

  1. Provide other people with complete information on how to start and write an RTS game from scratch	
  2. Have a fully working RTS game by September 2008
  3. Get some experience in writing games to go towards CodeName StarQuest

And a great video to finish off the post [Clicky](http://youtube.com/watch?v=54vtXRI32MQ)
