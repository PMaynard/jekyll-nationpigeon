I have decide to start work on a simple RTS game, it will use python and some other modules.  I will start work on it once I have finished collage, next week, I hope to have it completed or at least more than half way finished by the start of the collage.  The game will be open source and I will keep a log of how I created and what tutorial/information I have used to learn the python language.

There are three main goals, these are:
<ol>
	<li>Provide other people with complete information on how to start and write an RTS game from scratch</li>
	<li>Have a fully working RTS game by September 2008</li>
	<li>Get some experience in writing games to go towards CodeName StarQuest</li>
</ol>
And a great video to finish off the post <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=54vtXRI32MQ">Clicky</a>
