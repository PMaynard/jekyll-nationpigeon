I forgot to mention that I have created a mobile version of this site at <a href="http://mobile.nationpigeon.com">http://mobile.nationpigeon.com</a>.  If you are viewing this site on a screen resolution below 640x480 then you will be re-directed to the mobile version.

I hope to implement an option where by you will be able to choose to use the mobile version or not.
