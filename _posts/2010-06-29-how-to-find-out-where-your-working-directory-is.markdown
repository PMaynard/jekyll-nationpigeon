If you are writing some code using some sort of crazy IDE that creates lots of folders and files all over the place, trying to find where to put extra files for your application to find and read can be hard.  But not now with Pete's easy directory finding solution!

Instead of trying and failing to read the file, simple create a file using your application and then find the file using a folder explorer 

fopen("data.txt", "w"); 

Hope this helps, lol
