Hey, I changed the site theme to have next and previous posts at the bottom of each full post.  It doesn't really work when there are no more before it, because it leaves a floaty line :/ .  I'm sure there's something that will fix that.

Now I'm off to find food.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://nationpigeon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/roar-food.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-461" title="Roar Food" src="http://nationpigeon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/roar-food-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
