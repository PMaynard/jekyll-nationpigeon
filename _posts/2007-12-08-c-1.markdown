Okay to start programming in C++ you need to have a compiler. A compiler turns your source code into binary computer talk. The best compiler for you if your running Linux will be g++ (Just type g++ <filename>, in the terminal), or if your on Windows you might want to try <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html" title="Dev C++">Dev C++</a>. Dev C++ is an IDE, which stands for Integrated Development Environment, an IDE combines the editor, compiler and other useful tools in the same software package.

Right now that you have downloaded your compiler/IDE. You want to learn some C++. To start with I will explain how to do this in Ubuntu 7.10 and I might if your lucky quickly go through how to set up and run Dev C++, but that&rsquo;s not hard. If you are following along in using an IDE then you just type the code into it and click on compile and then run.<o:p></o:p>

Now to write a simple "Hello World!" example.
<pre>#include <iostream>

main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}</pre>
Line one (#include <iostream>)  is needed so that you can use the std::cout command

Line Two is the main function, which needs to be in all programs, it&rsquo;s the function that gets called first. And then anything the the curly braces runs.<o:p></o:p>

Line three is the command that prints out the text to the screen<o:p></o:p>

Line four tells the computer that the program has finished and everything is okay and happy with dogs and cats all over the place<o:p></o:p>

Erm yeah that&rsquo;s about it. Not really very helpful, but I have ran out of time. I will either edit this or make a new one. Bye for now.<o:p></o:p>
