It is good practice to include lots of comments in your code so that when you or someone else comes back and looks at the code you/they will understand what it is meant to do.

A comment will be ignored by the compiler, this means that anything in between the comment tags will not become a program. (Makes any scene?)

Normally there are two ways to write comments, one is a single line, and one is a multi line comment.  There names explain what they mean.

So in Java a single line comment will look like this:

    
    // Comment Text


And a multi line comment will look like this:

    
    /*



    
    More than one line



    
    See!*/


And in C++ a single line comment will look like this:

    
    // Comment Text


And a multi line comment will look like this:

    
    /*



    
    More than one line



    
    See!*/


And in python a singe line comment is done like is:

    
    # Comment text


And a multi lined comment will go like this:

    
    
    " " " this is a multi line comment
    
      which spawns many lines
    
    " " "


As you can see Java and C++ have the same way of creating comments but Python has a different way just to let you know that all languages do not have th same way of commenting text.

And for a small side note here is how to write comments in HTML and PHP.

HTML

    
    <!-- Comment text in here -->


PHP

    
    // Comment text in here - Single line



    
    
    /* Comment text in here,
    
    many lines
    
    */


Hope this helps, Pete
