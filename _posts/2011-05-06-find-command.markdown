The find command is  very useful for organizing your files and folders, or in combination with bash scripting. For example I had an mp3 player which would only play mp3s that were not inside a directory.Â  Now all my music is located inside sub-directories, so I could spend most of my day moving them out, or I could use the find command.

    
    find . -iname \*.mp3 -type f -exec cp {} ./local/ \;


This line here will search every file and folder in the current directory, and if the file ends in "**.mp3**" then it will be copied to a folder called "**local**",

A break down of the command is like this.
**-iname** - Base of the file name with all leading directories removed.
**-type f** - The file is of type "**regular file**", for directories the flag is "**d**".
**-exec** - This executes a command if 0 status is returned, if there is a file,
**cp {} ./local/ \;** - "**cp**" is the command to be run. "**{}**" is replaced by the current file name being processed, "**\;**" terminates the command.

Hope this helps,
