Whist I was tidying my room, I found the reason why I am no good at maths.  I found all my maths work from primary to secondary school,  stuffed into a folder which 95% of said folder contains the printed manual of Sid Meier's Civilization all 123 Pages of it.

I also found a book in my book collection about Data Structure Techniques, I dident even know I owned a book with anything to do with data structures ^_^.
