Hello and welcome to the first post useing Wordpress on Nation Pigeon Blog thingy.

I will be your admin.  My names Pete.  This whole thing started on the morning of October the 23 third  2007.  Whilst I was looking for the other sock to the one which was on my foot I thought of a great idea.  This Idea was <strong>National Pigeon day! </strong>But you know about that don't you :D

Anyway back to on track.  That morning I was happy I had a great idea and I was about to set-up a cool web site with domain name and everything.   I decided to go a sign up with streamline.net, they had a good deal for two years as well as a free dot co dot uk domain.  All was going well untill I got the e-mail with an invoice.  *Shock* it said that I had bought for two years a dot com domain and not a dot co dot uk.  This mistake cost me &pound;19.9!  And to make it worse I spelt the name wrong.  I ment to write "<strong>nationalpigeon.co.uk</strong>" but I wrote "<strong>nationpigeon.com</strong>".  If I wanted to get a refund I would not be refunded the &pound;19.98 for the domain registration.

haha, never mind hey :D

So there, that's the first post on nation<strong><em>pigeon</em></strong>.
Pete
