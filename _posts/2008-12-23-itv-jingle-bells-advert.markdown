I finaly found it after sending an e-mail to ITV.&nbsp; I found the music that they used on thier movies advert.&nbsp; I think this is the bestest version ever <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Barbra+Streisand/_/Jingle+Bells" target="_blank">Listen for your self </a>Jingle Bells sang by Barbara Streisand.

Merry Christmas Every One!
