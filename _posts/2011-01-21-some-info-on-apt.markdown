`apt-get install food`

apt is a very cool and easy to use package manager for UNIX based systems.  Here are some simple and effective commands that might help you do things XD

**apt-get update** - makes sure that all the information is newest.

**apt-get upgrade** - checks for all packages that needs to be updated.

**apt-get remove _`<package>`_** - Removes the package from the system.

**apt-get purge _`<package>`_** - Same as remove but deletes all the configuration files.

**apt-cache search** - This can be useful if you don't know the package name, e.g "_apt-cache search "stats" | more_"

**apt-cache depends _`<package>`_** - Lists all the packages dependences.

**apt-get -u install _`<package>`_** - Updates just the specified package.
