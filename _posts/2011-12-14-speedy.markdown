I was able to double the speed of my site, with one simple PHP module. <a title="Alternative PHP Cache" href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php" target="_blank">Alternative PHP Cache</a> (APC)

You can install it with any reasonable package manager. And with the default settings, you'll be seeing improvements. As this nice little table will show.

<h2>Stats</h2>
<table border="1">
<th></th>
<th>Before</th>
<th>After</th>
<tr>
  <td>Time taken for tests [seconds]</td>
  <td>259.386</td>
  <td>126.654</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Requests per second [#/sec]</td>
  <td>3.86</td>
  <td>7.90</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Time per request [ms]</td>
  <td>2593.862</td>
  <td>1266.539</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Transfer rate [Kbytes/sec] received</td>
  <td>106.16</td>
  <td>217.40</td>
</tr>
</table>

Stats created with <pre><b>ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://nationpigeon.com/</b></pre>

Now to get some CSS working for these table things.
