If your computer running Windows is starting to slow down, or running out of hard drive space then you might be in need of a simple program called <a href="http://filehippo.com/download_ccleaner/" target="_blank">CCleaner</a>.

<a href="/wordpress/wp-content/images/ccleaner/ccleaner_one.jpg"><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/images/ccleaner/ccleaner_one.jpg" title="[Image CCleaner ]" alt="[Image CCleaner ]" height="449" width="620" /></a>

I was able to save 1.77MB of space and that was just from tempary files that Windows creates for it's self.  I have save up to 4GB of space from useing CCleaner.  It's very good!
