If your computer running Windows is starting to slow down, or running out of hard drive space then you might be in need of a simple program called [CCleaner](http://filehippo.com/download_ccleaner/).

[![[Image CCleaner ]](/wordpress/wp-content/images/ccleaner/ccleaner_one.jpg)](/wordpress/wp-content/images/ccleaner/ccleaner_one.jpg)

I was able to save 1.77MB of space and that was just from tempary files that Windows creates for it's self.  I have save up to 4GB of space from useing CCleaner.  It's very good!
