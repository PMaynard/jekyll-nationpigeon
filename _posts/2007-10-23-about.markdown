Nationpigeon.com started in October 2007.

It was originally going to be for 'National Pigeon Day', but due to a slight spelling mistake it became 'Nation Pigeon'. This is now a place for random tech posts to congregate.

Nation Pigeon is maintained by <a href="http://petermaynard.co.uk" target="_BLANK">Pete Maynard</a>.

Pete is currently in his final year of BSc Computer Science. He has a keen interest in computer networks and programming. He enjoys network security and server administration.
