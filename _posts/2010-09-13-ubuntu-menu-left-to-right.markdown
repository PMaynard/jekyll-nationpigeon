In the latest versions of Ubuntu, they tend to have the default theme set to have the close, minimise and maximise options on the left hand side of the screen.  To change this simply go to the gconf-editor (Alt + F2 - "**gconf-editor**") Then change **apps->metacity->general->button_layout** to have the colon at the front instead of the end.  You might want to re-order the placement of the buttons as well.

Now here is a chibi maid - Stolen from [Direct Link](http://i712.photobucket.com/albums/ww123/Aeris-Died/chibiaeris-1.jpg) and [Related google image link](http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/art-shops-and-requests/a-e-r-i-s-d-i-e-d-s-s-w-i-t-c-h-temp-closed/t.46349011/ )
