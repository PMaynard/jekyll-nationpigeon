  content: I'm liking the idea of switching my WP theme to something like this, looks good and it's very light. I hope you don't mind but is this a customized one?

    Yeah, I've fixed a few bugs and changed the about page some.  I also made it display the content differently.  I would like it to display post images as well, but I haven't had time to implement. 
    
    I can send you the theme as it is if you want.  The theme name is Black-Green 0.1 by Ulysses Ronquillo
    
    Hope this helps, 
    Pete

  content: Yes please, I think this is perfect. Nice job with the changes, pretty slick. I'll probably play around with it so it works okay with jQuery but I don't think there will be any issues. Arigato gozaimasu~

I was board with the old look of the site. &nbsp;Now I have a new layout, and with 10min of tweaking to get it to my liking we now have this. &nbsp;As you can see we still have the old Nation Pigeon banner which was created way back on <a href="http://nationpigeon.com/?p=54">February 9, 2008</a>, it still has the original white lines on it. (anyone is welcome to remove them, in fact I might do it now ... )

I'm not too sure of this new layout. &nbsp;What do you think? Meh we'll keep it for a while and see what happens.

Oh and I have finally got around to install lightbox for the images theheeh. &nbsp;Here is an image to prove to you that it works.<a href="http://www.nationpigeon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Kick-Ass-Nicolas-Cage-and-Chloe-Moretz.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-342" title="Kick-Ass Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz" src="http://www.nationpigeon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Kick-Ass-Nicolas-Cage-and-Chloe-Moretz-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>
