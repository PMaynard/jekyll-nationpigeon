Its never there when you want it, but all ways there when you don't.  Right click open location in terminal, this is a very useful feature and saves loads of time.  

To install it in Ubuntu and probably any other distribution that uses nautilus, install the package "nautilus-open-terminal"


    
    sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal



    
    su -c 'yum install nautilus-open-terminal'
