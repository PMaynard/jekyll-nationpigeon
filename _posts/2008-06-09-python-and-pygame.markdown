I have had a play around with PyGame and this is what I have been able to do. [PyGame Mess One](http://www.nationpigeon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pygame-mess.zip) these where made by taking bits from the example code, line by line chimp and other PyGame games.  erm I created them along time ago so I can't really remember where I got the code from.

Well the next post will have something more interesting and useful that's a promise!
