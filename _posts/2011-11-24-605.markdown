I've just completed updating my VPS. (Thanks <a href="https://clients.allsimple.net/aff.php?aff=033" title="All Simple" target="_blank">AllSimple</a>) We are now running 512MB RAM, previous 256MB, and more hard drive space. 

We are now running lighttpd instead of apache, in an attempt to save memory. Though this may change once I get around to researching it some more. 

I also have a load of draft posts, ready to be erm posted. So hopefully they will get finished soon. 

I think a change in layout is long overdue. 

Thanks to (<a href="http://emil.haukeland.name/webservers/2010/url-rewriting-for-wordpress-and-lighttpd/" target="_blank">http://emil.haukeland.name/webservers/2010/url-rewriting-for-wordpress-and-lighttpd/</a>) For getting my permalinks to work.
