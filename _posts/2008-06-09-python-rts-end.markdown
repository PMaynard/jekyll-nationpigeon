This post will have all the information about the Python based RTS that I am about to start to develop with the help of everyone in Nation Pigeon forum. It will be written with python as the main language and then extra modules expected to be used will be PyGame, twisted and possible PyOpenGL.

This post will have all the information that I have used to create the game, this will include all the tutorials to learn python and the the example and testing code. Basically it will be a tutorial on how to create a python based RTS, or at the least an introduction into python and gaming.

The has to be playable on all platforms and open source! For more information [check out the forum](../../forum/index.php/board,9.0.html).

**First Update 9th June 2008**

I have had a play around with PyGame and this is what I have been able to do. [PyGame Mess One](../wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pygame-mess.zip) these where made by taking bits from the example code, line by line chimp and other PyGame games. erm I created them along time ago so I can’t really remember where I got the code from.

Well the next post will have something more interesting and useful that’s a promise!

More coming in the next week \[SORRY PROJECT ABANDOND\]
