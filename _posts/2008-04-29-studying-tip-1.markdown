    ah yes, that is why you must keep them organised, e.g Needed For Exam Section / Needed for revision Section / Needed for wtf what is this section.  
    
    All though most does go into the last section regardless.
    
    (I had a strange feeling that some one was going to post a reply to this, I kept checking back) 
    You really need to get your self a gravatar Kev Kev.
    
    lol, Pete

    Go to http://www.gravatar.com and sign up using your email and then upload a picture, see right,once you have done that it will assign that picture to your e-mail address so when you post on a gravatar enabled blog, like mine, your comment will come up with a picture. 
    
    And best of all you can change the picture at any time and all the comments that you have made will change to the new one. ^_^ 
    
    Enjoy

Studying Tip Number One:
<blockquote><strong>Always Keep your notes tidy and in order.</strong>

<em>Make sure to keep all notes/handout that you are given by your tutor safe, secure and organized no matter what they are!  Whatever they give you it will be in the exam/assignment. </em></blockquote>
I'm trying to write a report about network design and disk analysis, I can't find anything in my notes/handouts argh lol.  I have the network design more or less done, I'm about to start on the disk analysis.  Here's what I have at the moment <a href="http://www.nationpigeon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/network-design-betafour.pdf" title="CSNC Beta 4">CSNC Beta 4</a>

And if your wondering why I haven't written anything in a while it's because of collage ^_^ oh and Karate.

Hope this has helped someone. If only I knew this at the start of the year ^_*
