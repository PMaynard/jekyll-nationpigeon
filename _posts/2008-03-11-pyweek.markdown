Okay on the 30th of (March) this month  to the 6th of April [PyWeek](http://www.pyweek.org/) is happening.  It's a week where python game programmers are given to create a game useing pyGame, pyOpengl etc.

Would any one be interested in creating a team?  I will be doing it even if no one is.  You don't need to know how to program, although it will help.  You can be the Idea guy, the art guy, the testing guy, the other guy or what ever guy.  If you would like to join me or do it your self go on and sign up on the [PyWeek](http://www.pyweek.org/register/) site.

If you want to be in a Team with me get in contact with me here as a comment or in the forum or however :P

Go on give it a go!
