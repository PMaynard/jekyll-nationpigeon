I was going to change the appearance of the site. But after looking around I got bored and just updated the CSS to make pre tags nicer.

Not much better mind you, but at least it's something. Oh and I created a new category, called [Windows](http://nationpigeon.com/category/windowz/) for all them windows do-hickys.
