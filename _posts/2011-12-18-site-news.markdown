I was going to change the appearance of the site. But after looking around I got bored and just updated the CSS to make pre tags nicer, see.
<pre>                                                                                                                                                               Hi</pre>
Not much better mind you, but at least it's something. Oh and I created a new category, called <a href="http://nationpigeon.com/category/windowz/">Windows</a> for all them windows do-hickys.
